1. Star Schema: Star schema is a data model that separates the data into a central fact table and several dimension tables. The fact table contains the measures, and the dimension tables provide descriptive information about the measures.
2. Snowflake Schema: Snowflake schema is a type of data model where each dimension is normalized into its own table. This model allows for flexible querying and efficient data storage.
3. Fact Constellation: Fact constellation is a data model that uses multiple fact tables to represent different levels of granularity in the data. This model is useful in situations where different levels of detail are needed for different business processes.
4. Star Schema: Star schema is a data model that uses a central fact table and multiple dimension tables to represent the data. This model is useful in situations where the data needs to be analyzed based on multiple dimensions.
5. Snowflake Schema: Snowflake schema is a data model that uses a central fact table and multiple dimension tables that are related to each other through relationships. This model is useful in situations where the data needs to be analyzed based on multiple dimensions and the relationships between the dimensions are complex.
6. Multidimensional Model: Multidimensional model is a data model that uses a cube structure to represent the data. This model is useful in situations where the data needs to be analyzed based on multiple dimensions and hierarchies. Azure Synapse Analytics supports multidimensional modeling using the Analysis Services (SSAS) component.
7. Tabular Model: Tabular model is a data model that uses a table structure to represent the data. This model is useful in situations where the data needs to be analyzed based on multiple columns and relationships. Azure Synapse Analytics supports tabular modeling using the Analysis Services (SSAS) component
8. Machine Learning Model: Azure Synapse Analytics also supports machine learning using the Azure Machine Learning service. This enables you to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models directly in the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
