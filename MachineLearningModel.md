Here is an example of creating a machine learning model in Azure Synapse Analytics using Azure Machine Learning service:
1. Open Azure Machine Learning service and create a new experiment.
2. Connect the experiment to your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
3. Load the data into the experiment using the Azure Synapse Analytics data source.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Select a machine learning algorithm and train the model on the training data.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
7. Deploy the model as a web service in the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
