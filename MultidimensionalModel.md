Here is an example of creating a multidimensional model in Azure Synapse Analytics using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT):
1. Open SSDT and create a new Analysis Services Multidimensional and Data Mining Project.
2. Add a new data source that points to your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
3. Add a new cube to the project.
4. Define the dimension structures and hierarchies, such as date, product, store, etc.
5. Define the measures, such as sales amount.
6. Deploy the cube to the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
