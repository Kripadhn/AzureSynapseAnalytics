Here is an example of creating a tabular model in Azure Synapse Analytics using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT):
1. Open SSDT and create a new Analysis Services Tabular Project.
2. Add a new data source that points to your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
3. Add a new table to the project.
4. Define the columns and relationships between tables.
5. Define the calculated columns and measures, such as sales amount.
6. Deploy the table to the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
